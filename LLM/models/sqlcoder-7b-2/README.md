# Update notice
The model weights were updated at 7 AM UTC on Feb 7, 2024. The new model weights lead to a much more performant model – particularly for joins.

If you downloaded the model before that, please redownload the weights for best performance.

## Model Details

### Model Description

<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this model is. -->

This is the model card of a 🤗 transformers model that has been pushed on the Hub. This model card has been automatically generated.

- **Developed by:** [Defog, Inc](https://defog.ai)
- **Model type:** [Text to SQL]
- **License:** [CC-by-SA-4.0]
- **Finetuned from model:** [CodeLlama-7B]

### Model Sources [optional]
- [**HuggingFace:**](https://huggingface.co/defog/sqlcoder-70b-alpha)
- [**GitHub:**](https://github.com/defog-ai/sqlcoder)
- [**Demo:**](https://defog.ai/sqlcoder-demo/)

## Uses

This model is intended to be used by non-technical users to understand data inside their SQL databases. It is meant as an analytics tool, and not as a database admin tool.

This model has not been trained to reject malicious requests from users with write access to databases, and should only be used by users with read-only access.

## How to Get Started with the Model

Use the code [here](https://github.com/defog-ai/sqlcoder/blob/main/inference.py) to get started with the model.

## Prompt

Please use the following prompt for optimal results. Please remember to use `do_sample=False` and `num_beams=4` for optimal results.

```
### Task
Generate a SQL query to answer [QUESTION]{user_question}[/QUESTION]

### Database Schema
The query will run on a database with the following schema:
{table_metadata_string_DDL_statements}

### Answer
Given the database schema, here is the SQL query that [QUESTION]{user_question}[/QUESTION]
[SQL]
```

## Evaluation

This model was evaluated on [SQL-Eval](https://github.com/defog-ai/sql-eval), a PostgreSQL based evaluation framework developed by Defog for testing and alignment of model capabilities.

You can read more about the methodology behind SQLEval [here](https://defog.ai/blog/open-sourcing-sqleval/).

### Results

We classified each generated question into one of 6 categories. The table displays the percentage of questions answered correctly by each model, broken down by category.
